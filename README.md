### What are math puzzles to me in computer science?
I don't have much reference for computer science in general, but I suppose I would consider a math puzzle in
 computer science to be a puzzle that you can break down into individual parts that you can then use programming to 
automate. As long as you know the steps, you should be able to get a computer to do them for you.  

### What's a puzzle that I like?
I'll admit that I'm not the greatest at puzzles, and not many come to mind, so I don't have a definite favorite.
 One type of puzzle that comes to mind is one that shows up a few times in the game The Last of Us Part II, in which 
there's a combination lock of some kind on a vault that almost always contains valuable resources. The game takes place 
after a sort of apocalypse, and the only way to find the combinations is by reading notes left behind by whoever locked 
them in the first place. Sometimes you'll just find the combination, but other times you might have to look around and 
find a calendar with an anniversary date marked that turns out to be the combination. They're simple and easy, but make 
you feel clever in the moment.
