## Solution to Crazy Cut Puzzle

This puzzle has a somewhat simple solution. 
The image provides a helpful grid that encourages you to count how many squares should be in the shape.
Upon finding that there would be twelve, one can simply cut the shape into two shapes each with six squares.
As an added bonus, this solution results in the same shape rotated in two different ways.
